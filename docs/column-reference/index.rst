Column Reference
================
geotech-pandas relies heavily on consistent column names and units. The package currently assumes
all units are in SI (International System of Units). These columns are summarized in the following
lists.

The columns are listed in the following format:

    column_name
        | Description
        | *unit*
        | ``dtype``

Soil Index Columns
------------------
.. glossary::

    {prefix}_mass_moist
        | Mass of container and moist specimen.
        | *grams (g)*
        | ``float``

    {prefix}_mass_dry

        | *grams (g)*
        | ``float``

    {prefix}_mass_container
        | Mass of container.
        | *grams (g)*
        | ``float``

    {prefix}_moisture_content
        | Moisture content. The ratio of the mass of water contained in the pore spaces of soil or
          rock material, to the solid mass of particles in that material. A standard temperature of
          110 ± 5°C is used to determine these masses.
        | *percent (%)*
        | ``float``

        .. note::

            The `{prefix}` indicated here is used to specify the prefix when calculating the
            moisture content. By default, the prefix is "moisture_content", however if the prefix is
            "moisture_content", :term:`{prefix}_moisture_content` would then become just
            `moisture_content` alone to avoid confusion.

            Moisture content mass measurements do not necessarily require using *grams (g)*
            as the unit. However, maintaining **consistency** in the chosen units is essential.

        | *drops*
        | ``int``

        | *percent (%)*
        | ``float``

        .. note::

            The `{n}` indicated here is used to specify the trial number when calculating the
            liquid limit.
    
    liquid_limit
