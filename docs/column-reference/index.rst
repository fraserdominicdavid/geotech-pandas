Column Reference
================
geotech-pandas relies heavily on consistent column names and units. The package currently assumes
all units are in SI (International System of Units). These columns are summarized in the following
lists.

The columns are listed in the following format:

    column_name
        | Description
        | *unit*
        | ``dtype``

.. _general-columns:

Soil Index Columns
------------------
.. glossary::

    {prefix}_mass_moist
        | Mass of container and moist specimen.
        | *grams (g)*
        | ``float``

    {prefix}_mass_dry
        | Mass of container and oven dry specimen.
        | *grams (g)*
        | ``float``

    {prefix}_mass_container
        | Mass of container.
        | *grams (g)*
        | ``float``

    {prefix}_moisture_content
        | Moisture content.
        | *percent (%)*
        | ``float``

        .. note::

            The `{prefix}` indicated here is used to specify the prefix when calculating the
            moisture content. By default, the prefix is "moisture_content", so
            :term:`{prefix}_moisture_content` would then become `moisture_content`.

            Moisture content mass measurements do not necessarily require using *grams (g)*
            as the unit. However, maintaining **consistency** in the chosen units is essential.

    liquid_limit_{n}_drops
        | Number of drops causing closure of the groove for trial `{n}`.
        | *drops*
        | ``int``

    liquid_limit_{n}_moisture_content
        | Moisture content for trial `{n}`.
        | *percent (%)*
        | ``float``

        .. note::

            The `{n}` indicated here is used to specify the trial number when calculating the
            liquid limit.

    plastic_limit_1_moisture_content
        | Moisture content for the first plastic limit test.
        | *percent (%)*
        | ``float``

    plastic_limit_2_moisture_content
        | Moisture content for the second plastic limit test.
        | *percent (%)*
        | ``float``
