Introduction
============
Geotechnical engineering encompasses the analysis, design, and construction of foundations,
earthworks, and retaining structures. It plays a crucial role in ensuring the stability and safety
of civil infrastructure projects. The :mod:`geotech-pandas` package is a :external:mod:`pandas`
extension that provides a suite of functions specifically tailored for geotechnical engineering
calculations, seamlessly integrating with the powerful data manipulation and analysis capabilities
of :external:mod:`pandas`. This open-source extension empowers geotechnical engineers to streamline
their workflow, enhance data analysis, and improve productivity.

.. note::

   The features and applications listed here can be treated as a general roadmap for the development
   of this extension. Features and applications that are not yet supported are marked with
   :bdg-secondary-line:`planned`.

Key features and benefits
-------------------------
- **Streamlined geotechnical calculations**
  
  Perform a wide range of geotechnical engineering calculations directly within
  :external:class:`~pandas.DataFrame` objects, through the use of subaccessors.

- **Enhanced data analysis**
  
  Leverage the comprehensive functionality of :external:mod:`pandas` to analyze and visualize
  geotechnical data effectively, enabling data-driven insights and decision-making.

- **Improved productivity**
  
  Automate repetitive geotechnical calculations, saving time and effort, and allowing engineers to
  focus on more complex tasks and analyses.

- **Soil property correlation reference**  :bdg-secondary-line:`planned`

  Access and apply various commonly used correlations for soil properties, providing a comprehensive
  resource for estimating missing soil parameters and enhancing the accuracy of geotechnical
  analyses and designs.

Targeted applications
---------------------

- **In-situ test calculations**

  Analyze data from in-situ tests such as standard penetration tests (SPTs) to derive soil
  properties and evaluate soil behavior.

- **Laboratory test calculations** :bdg-secondary-line:`planned`

  Analyze data from laboratory tests such as sieve analysis, Atterberg limits tests, and hydrometer
  tests to determine soil classification and index properties.

- **Soil liquefaction analysis** :bdg-secondary-line:`planned`

  Evaluate the liquefaction potential of soils subjected to earthquake loading.

- **Foundation design** :bdg-secondary-line:`planned`

  Analyze bearing capacity, settlement, and lateral loads for various foundation types.

- **Slope stability analysis** :bdg-secondary-line:`planned`

  Evaluate the stability of slopes subjected to different loading conditions.

- **Earthwork analysis** :bdg-secondary-line:`planned`

  Calculate volumes, compaction requirements, and stability of earthwork structures.

- **Retaining structure design** :bdg-secondary-line:`planned`

  Analyze the stability of retaining walls, sheet piles, and other earth-retaining structures.
